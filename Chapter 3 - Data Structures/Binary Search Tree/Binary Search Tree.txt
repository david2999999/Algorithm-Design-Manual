Binary Search Tree
    - All three dictionary operate (add, remove, find) takes O(h) time, where h is the height of the tree
        - Balanced tree h = logn
        - Unbalance tree h = n
            - Consider inserting elements in ascending order, the tree will become a skinny linear height tree, where
              only right pointers are used.
    - Binary trees can have heights ranging from logn to n.
