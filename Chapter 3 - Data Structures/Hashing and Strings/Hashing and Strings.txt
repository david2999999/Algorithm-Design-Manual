Hashing and Strings
    - Hash tables are a very practical way of maintaining a dictionary
        - It exploits that fact that looking an item up in an array takes constant time once you have its index
    - A hash function is a mathematical function that maps keys to integers
        - Generates an unique identifier number, but they are so large that they will exceed the number of slots in our hash table
        - We must reduce this number to an integer between 0 and (m - 1), where m is the number of slots
        - We can do this by performing a modulus on the our hash number

Collision Resolution
    - No matter how good our hash functions are, we should be prepare for collisions
        - Two distinct keys will occasionally hash to the same value
    - Collision Resolutions approaches
        - Chaining
            - represent the hash table as an array of linked list
                - The ith list represents all of the items that hash to the value of i
                - If n keys are distributed uniformly in a table, each list will contain roughly n/m elements, making them a constant size when m equals n
            - Devotes a considerable amount of memory to points
                - This is space that could make the table larger, hence the list shorter
        - Open Addressing
            - Hash table is maintained as an array of elements
                - On an insertion, we check to see if the desired position is empty
                    - if the position is empty, insert the value at the index
                    - if the position is not empty, we must find another place to insert the value instead
            - Sequential probing inserts the item in the next open slot in the table
                - If the table is not too full
                    - contiguous runs of items should be fairly small, hence the location should only be a few slots from its intended position
                - Searching for a given key now involves going to the appropriate hash value and check to see if the item is there
                    - If so, return it
                    - Otherwise we must keep checking through the length of the run
                - Deletion in an open addressing scheme can get ugly
                    - removing one element might break a chain of insertions, making some elements inaccessible
                    - We have to reinsert all the items in the run following the new hole
