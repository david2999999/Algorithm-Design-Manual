Priority Queues
    - Many algorithms process items in a specific order
        - Suppose you must schedule jobs according to their importance relative to other jobs
        - Scheduling jobs requires sorting them by importance
    - Priority queues provide more flexibility than simple sorting
        - they allow new elements to enter a system at arbitrary intervals
        - It is more cost effective to insert a new job into a priority queue than to re-sort everything every arrival
    - The basic priority queue supports three primary operations
        - insert an item with key k
        - Find minimum/maximum
        - Delete minimum/maximum
