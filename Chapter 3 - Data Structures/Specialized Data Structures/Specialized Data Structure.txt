Specialized Data Structures
    - There are data structures for representing more structured or specialized kinds of object, such as points in space, string and graphs
    - The design principles of these data structures are the same as for basic objects
        - There is a set of basic operations we need to perform repeatedly

    - String data structures
        - Characters strings are typically represented by arrays of characters
        - Suffix trees/arrays are special data structures that preprocess strings to make pattern matching operations faster
