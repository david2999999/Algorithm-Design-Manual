Specialized Data Structures
    - There are data structures for representing more structured or specialized kinds of object, such as points in space, string and graphs
    - The design principles of these data structures are the same as for basic objects
        - There is a set of basic operations we need to perform repeatedly

    - String data structures
        - Characters strings are typically represented by arrays of characters
        - Suffix trees/arrays are special data structures that preprocess strings to make pattern matching operations faster

    - Geometric data structures
        - Geometric data consists of collections of data points and regions
        - Regions in the plane can be described by polygons, where the boundary of the polygon is given by a chain of line segments
            - Such as an array of points (v1, v2, ..., vn), such at (vi, vi+1) is a segment of the boundary
        - Spatial data structures such as kd-trees organize points and regions by geometric location to support fast search

    - Graph data structures
        - Graphs are typically represented using either adjacency matrices or adjacency lists
            - The choice of representation can have a substantial impact on the design of the resulting graph algorithm

    - Set data structures
        - Subsets of items are typically represented using dictionary to support fast membership queries
        - Bit vectors are boolean arrays such that the ith bit represents true if i is in the subset
        - Union-find data structure for maintaining set partitions
