Queues – Support retrieval in first in, first out (FIFO) order. This is surely
the fairest way to control waiting times for services. You want the container
holding jobs to be processed in FIFO order to minimize the maximum time
spent waiting. Note that the average waiting time will be the same regardless
of whether FIFO or LIFO is used. Many computing applications involve data
items with infinite patience, which renders the question of maximum waiting
time moot.

Queues are somewhat trickier to implement than stacks and thus are most
appropriate for applications (like certain simulations) where the order is important.
The put and get operations for queues are usually called enqueue
and dequeue.
    – Enqueue(x,q): Insert item x at the back of queue q.
    – Dequeue(q): Return (and remove) the front item from queue q.

We will see queues later as the fundamental data structure controlling
breadth-first searches in graphs.
