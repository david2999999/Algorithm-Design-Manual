Stacks – Support retrieval by last-in, first-out (LIFO) order. Stacks are simple
to implement and very efficient. For this reason, stacks are probably the
right container to use when retrieval order doesn’t matter at all, such as
when processing batch jobs. The put and get operations for stacks are usually
called push and pop:
    – Push(x,s): Insert item x at the top of stack s.
    – Pop(s): Return (and remove) the top item of stack s.

LIFO order arises in many real-world contexts. People crammed into a subway
car exit in LIFO order. Food inserted into my refrigerator usually exits the
same way, despite the incentive of expiration dates. Algorithmically, LIFO
tends to happen in the course of executing recursive algorithms.
