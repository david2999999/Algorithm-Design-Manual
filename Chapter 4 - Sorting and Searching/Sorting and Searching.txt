Importance of Sorting
    - Sorting is the basic building block that many other algorithms are built around
    - Many algorithms appear in the context of sorting, such as divide-and-conquer, data structures and randomized algorithsm
    - Computers have historically spent more time sorting than anything else

Applications of Sorting
    - Searching
        - Binary search tests whether an item is in a dictionary in O(logn), provided the keys are all sorted

    - Closest Pair
        - Given a set of numbers, how do you find the pair of numbers that have the smallest difference between them?
            - Once our numbers are sorted, the closest pair of numbers must lie next to each other somewhere in sorted order
            - A linear time scan completes the job, for a total of O(nlogn) time including the sorting

    - Element Uniqueness
        - Are there duplicates in a given set of n items?
            - this is a special case of the closest-pair problem, we we ask if there is a pair separated by a gap of zero
        - The most efficient algorithm involving sorting the numbers and then do a linear scan through all adjacent pairs
            - This is O(nlogn) + O(n) = O(nlogn)
        - If we want to achieve O(n) time complexity, we need a data structure to hold previously seen values
            - This method will cost O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity

    - Frequency Distribution
        - Given a sorted set of n items, which element occurs the largest number of times in the set?
            - If the items are sorted, we can sweep from left to right and count them
                - since all identical items will be lumped together during sorting
        - To find out how often an arbitrary element k occurs, look up k using binary search in a sorted array of keys
            - After we find the key, we can walk to the left of this point until the first element is not k, and then doing the same to the right
            - This time complexity of this approach is O(logn + c), where c is the number of occurrence of k
            - A more efficient solution will be doing a double binary search, one for the left index and one for the right index
                - Then the number of occurrence will be the difference between the two indices
                - The runtime of this approach is O(logn) + O(logn) = O(logn)

    - Selection - What is the kth largest element in an array?
        - If the keys are placed in sorted order, the kth largest can be found in constant time by looking at the kth position
        - The median element appears in (n/2)nd position in sorted order

    - Convex Hull - What is the polygon of the smallest area that contains a given set of n points in two dimensions
        - The convex hull is like a rubber band stretched over the points in the plane and then released
        - The convex hull gives a nice representation of the shape of the points and is an important building blocks for more sophisticated
          geometric algorithms
        - How can we use sorting to construct the convex hull?
            - we can have the points sorted by x-coordinate
                - Then the points can be inserted from left to right into the hull
            - Adding a new right-most point may cause others to be deleted, but we can quickly identify these points because they lie inside
              the polygon formed by adding the new point
                - These points will be neighbors of the previous point we inserted, so they will be easy to find an delete
                - The total time is linear after the sorting has been done
