Importance of Sorting
    - Sorting is the basic building block that many other algorithms are built around
    - Many algorithms appear in the context of sorting, such as divide-and-conquer, data structures and randomized algorithsm
    - Computers have historically spent more time sorting than anything else

Applications of Sorting
    - Searching
        - Binary search tests whether an item is in a dictionary in O(logn), provided the keys are all sorted
    - Closest Pair
        - Given a set of numbers, how do you find the pair of numbers that have the smallest difference between them?
            - Once our numbers are sorted, the closest pair of numbers must lie next to each other somewhere in sorted order
            - A linear time scan completes the job, for a total of O(nlogn) time including the sorting
