## Data Structures
Changing a data structure in a slow program can work the same way an organ
transplant does in a sick patient. Important classes of abstract data types such as
containers, dictionaries, and priority queues, have many different but functionally
equivalent data structures that implement them. Changing the data structure does
not change the correctness of the program, since we presumably replace a correct
implementation with a different correct implementation. However, the new implementation
of the data type realizes different tradeoffs in the time to execute various
operations, so the total performance can improve dramatically. Like a patient in
need of a transplant, only one part might need to be replaced in order to fix the
problem.
